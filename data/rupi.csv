how is it so easy for you
to be kind to people he asked
milk and honey dripped
from my lips as i answered
cause people have not
been kind to me
the first boy that kissed me
held my shoulders down
like the handlebars of
the first bicycle
he ever rode
i was five
he had the smell of
starvation on his lips
which he picked up from
his father feasting on his mother at 4 a.m.
he was the first boy
to teach me my body was
for giving to those that wanted
that i should feel anything
less than whole
and my god
did i feel as empty
as his mother at 4:25 a.m.
ive had sex she said
but i dont know
what making love
feels like
i came all this way
to give you all these things
but you arent even looking
the abused
and the
abuser
 i have been both
i am undoing you
from my skin
it wasnt you i was kissing
 dont be mistaken
it was him on my mind
your lips were just convenient
it always comes back to you
boils
circles
itches
its way back to you
i was music
but you had your ears cut off
my tongue is sour
from the hunger of
missing you
i will not have you
build me into your life
when
what i want is to
build a life with you
 the difference
if i knew what
safety looked like
i would have spent
less time falling into
arms that were not
rivers fall from my mouth
tears my eyes cant carry
you are snakeskin
and i keep shedding you somehow
my mind is forgetting
every exquisite detail
of your face
the letting go has
become the forgetting
which is the most
pleasant and saddest thing
to have happened
you were not wrong for leaving
you were wrong for coming back
and thinking
you could have me
when it was convenient
and leave when it was not
how can i write
if he took my hands
with him
neither of us is happy
but neither of us wants to leave
so we keep breaking one another
and calling it love
we began
with honesty
let us end
in it too
 us
your voice
alone
drives me
to tears
i dont know why
i split myself open
for others knowing
sewing myself up
hurts this much
afterward
people go
but how
they left
always stays
sex takes the consent of two
if one person is lying there not doing anything
cause they are not ready
or not in the mood
or simply dont want to
yet the other is having sex
with their body its not love
it is rape
love is not cruel
we are cruel
love is not a game
we have made a game
out of love
how can our love die
if its written
in these pages
even after the hurt
the loss
the pain
the breaking
your body is still
the only one
i want to be
undressed under
the night after you left
i woke up so broken
the only place to put the pieces
were the bags under my eyes
stay
i whispered
as you
shut the door behind you
i am confident i am over you. so much that some mornings i
wake up with a smile on my face and my hands pressed
together thanking the universe for pulling you out of me.
thank god i cry. thank god you left. i would not be the empire
i am today if you had stayed.
but then.
there are some nights i imagine what i might do if you showed
up. how if you walked into the room this very second every
awful thing youve ever done would be tossed out the closest
window and all the love would rise up again. it would pour
through my eyes as if it never really left in the first place. as if
its been practicing how to stay silent so long only so it could
be this loud on your arrival. can someone explain that. how
even when the love leaves. it doesnt leave. how even when i
am so past you. i am so helplessly brought back to you.
he isnt coming back
whispered my head
he has to
sobbed my heart
 wilting
i dont want to be friends
i want all of you
 more
the idea that we are
so capable of love
but still choose
to be toxic
i am losing parts of you like i lose eyelashes
unknowingly and everywhere
you cannot leave
and have me too
i cannot exist in
two places at once
 when you ask if we can still be friends
i am water
soft enough
to offer life
tough enough
to drown it away
what i miss most is how you loved me. but what i didnt
know was how you loved me had so much to do with the
person i was. it was a reflection of everything i gave to you.
coming back to me. how did i not see that. how. did i sit here
soaking in the idea that no one else would love me that way.
when it was i that taught you. when it was i that showed you
how to fill. the way i needed to be filled. how cruel i was to
myself. giving you credit for my warmth simply because you
had felt it. thinking it was you who gave me strength. wit.
beauty. simply because you recognized it. as if i was already
not these things before i met you. as if i did not remain all
these once you left.
you leave
but you dont stay gone
why do you do that
why do you
abandon the thing you want to keep
why do you linger
in a place you do not want to stay
why do you think its okay to do both
go and return all at once
i will tell you about selfish people. even when they know
they will hurt you they walk into your life to taste you
because you are the type of being they dont want to miss out
on. you are too much shine to not be felt. so when they have
gotten a good look at everything you have to offer. when they
have taken your skin your hair your secrets with them. when
they realize how real this is. how much of a storm you are and
it hits them.
that is when the cowardice sets in. that is when the person
you thought they were is replaced by the sad reality of what
they are. that is when they lose every fighting bone in their
body and leave after saying you will find better than me.
you will stand there naked with half of them still hidden
somewhere inside you and sob. asking them why they did it.
why they forced you to love them when they had no
intention of loving you back and theyll say something along
the lines of i just had to try. i had to give it a chance. it was
you after all.
but that isnt romantic. it isnt sweet. the idea that they were
so engulfed by your existence they had to risk breaking it for
the sake of knowing they werent the one missing out. your
existence meant that little next to their curiosity of you.
that is the thing about selfish people. they gamble entire
beings. entire souls to please their own. one second they are
holding you like the world in their lap and the next they have
belittled you to a mere picture. a moment. something of the
past. one second. they swallow you up and whisper they
want to spend the rest of their life with you. but the moment
they sense fear. they are already halfway out the door.
without having the nerve to let you go with grace. as if the
human heart means that little to them.
and after all this. after all of the taking. the nerve. isnt it sad
and funny how people have more guts these days to undress
you with their fingers than they do to pick up the phone and
call. apologize. for the loss. and this is how you lose her.
 selfish
to do list (after the breakup):
1. take refuge in your bed.
2. cry. till the tears stop (this will take a few days).
3. dont listen to slow songs.
4. delete their number from your phone even though it is
 memorized on your fingertips.
5. dont look at old photos.
6. find the closest ice cream shop and treat yourself to two
 scoops of mint chocolate chip. the mint will calm your heart.
 you deserve the chocolate.
7. buy new bed sheets.
 it and drop it off at a donation center.
9. plan a trip.
10. perfect the art of smiling and nodding when someone brings
 their name up in conversation.
11. start a new project.
12. whatever you do. do not call.
13. do not beg for what does not want to stay.
14. stop crying at some point.
15. allow yourself to feel foolish for believing you couldve built
 the rest of your life in someone elses stomach.
16. breathe.
the way they
leave
tells you
everything
there is no bigger illusion in the world
than the idea that a woman will
bring dishonor into a home
if she tries to keep her heart
and her body safe
perhaps
i dont deserve
nice things
cause i am paying
for sins i dont
remember
the thing about writing is
i cant tell if its healing
or destroying me
do not bother holding on to
that thing that does not want you
 you cannot make it stay
you must enter a relationship
with yourself
before anyone else
accept that you deserve more
than painful love
life is moving
the healthiest thing
for your heart is
to move with it
it is a part of the
human experience to feel pain
do not be afraid
open yourself to it
 evolving
loneliness is a sign you are in desperate need of yourself
you are in the habit
of codepending
on people to
make up for what
you think you lack
who tricked you
into believing
another person
was meant to complete you
when the most they can do is complement
do not look for healing
at the feet of those
who broke you
you pinned
my legs to
the ground
with your feet
and demanded
i stand up
if you were born with
the weakness to fall
you were born with
the strength to rise
perhaps the saddest of all
are those who live waiting
for someone theyre not
sure exists
 7 billion people
stay strong through your pain
grow flowers from it
you have helped me
grow flowers out of mine so
bloom beautifully
dangerously
loudly
bloom softly
however you need
just bloom
 to the reader
i thank the universe
for taking
everything it has taken
and giving to me
everything it is giving
 balance
it takes grace
to remain kind
in cruel situations
fall
in love
with your solitude
there is a difference between
someone telling you
they love you and
them actually
loving you
sometimes
the apology
never comes
when it is wanted
and when it comes
it is neither wanted
nor needed
 you are too late
you tell me
i am not like most girls
and learn to kiss me with your eyes closed
something about the phrasesomething about
how i have to be unlike the women
i call sisters in order to be wanted
makes me want to spit your tongue out
like i am supposed to be proud you picked me
as if i should be relieved you think
i am better than them
the next time he
points out the
hair on your legs is
growing back remind
that boy your body
is not his home
he is a guest
warn him to
never outstep
his welcome
again
the rape will
tear you
in half
but it
will not
end you
to be
soft
is
to be
powerful
you deserve to be
completely found
in your surroundings
not lost within them
i know its hard
believe me
i know it feels like
tomorrow will never come
and today will be the most
difficult day to get through
but i swear you will get through
the hurt will pass
as it always does
if you give it time and
let it so let it
go
slowly
like a broken promise
let it go
i like the way the stretch marks
on my thighs look human and
that were so soft yet
rough and jungle wild
when we need to be
i love that about us
how capable we are of feeling
how unafraid we are of breaking
and tend to our wounds with grace
just being a woman
calling myself
a woman
makes me utterly whole
and complete
my issue with what they consider beautiful
is their concept of beauty
centers around excluding people
i find hair beautiful
when a woman wears it
like a garden on her skin
that is the definition of beauty
big hooked noses
pointing upward to the sky
like theyre rising
to the occasion
skin the color of earth
my ancestors planted crops on
to feed a lineage of women with
thighs thick as tree trunks
eyes like almonds
deeply hooded with conviction
the rivers of punjab
flow through my bloodstream so
dont tell me my women
arent as beautiful
as the ones in
your country
our backs
tell stories
no books have
the spine to
carry
 women of color
accept yourself
as you were designed
your body
is a museum
of natural disasters
can you grasp how
stunning that is
you have sadness
living in places
sadness shouldnt live
losing you
was the becoming
of myself
other womens bodies
are not our battlegrounds
removing all the hair
off your body is okay
if thats what you want to do
just as much as keeping all the hair
on your body is okay
if thats what you want to do
 you belong only to yourself
apparently it is ungraceful of me
to mention my period in public
cause the actual biology
of my body is too real
it is okay to sell whats
between a womans legs
more than it is okay to
mention its inner workings
the recreational use of
this body is seen as
beautiful while
its nature is
seen as ugly
you were a dragon long before
he came around and said
you could fly
you will remain a dragon
long after hes left
i want to apologize to all the women
i have called pretty
before ive called them intelligent or brave
i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what youre born with
is the most you have to be proud of when your
spirit has crushed mountains
from now on i will say things like
you are resilient or you are extraordinary
not because i dont think youre pretty
but because you are so much more than that
i have
what i have
and i am happy
ive lost
what ive lost
and i am
still
happy
 outlook
you look at me and cry
everything hurts
i hold you and whisper
but everything can heal
if the hurt comes
so will the happiness
 be patient
a daughter should
not have to
beg her father
for a relationship
the name kaur
makes me a free woman
it removes the shackles that
try to bind me
uplifts me
to remind me i am equal to
any man even though the state
of this world screams to me i am not
that i am my own woman and
i belong wholly to myself
and the universe
it humbles me
calls out and says i have a
universal duty to share with
humanity to nurture
and serve the sisterhood
to raise those that need raising
the name kaur runs in my blood
it was in me before the word itself existed
it is my identity and my liberation
 kaur
 a woman of sikhi
the world
gives you
so much pain
and here you are
making gold out of it
 there is nothing purer than that
how you love yourself is
how you teach others
to love you
my heart aches for sisters more than anything
it aches for women helping women
like flowers ache for spring
the goddess between your legs
makes mouths water
you
are your own
soul mate
some people
are so bitter
to them
you must be kindest
we all move forward when
we recognize how resilient
and striking the women
around us are
for you to see beauty here
does not mean
there is beauty in me
it means there is beauty rooted
so deep within you
you cant help but
see it everywhere
hair
if it was not supposed to be there
would not be growing
on our bodies in the first place
 we are at war with what comes most naturally to us
trying to convince myself
i am allowed
to take up space
is like writing with
my left hand
when i was born
to use my right
 the idea of shrinking is hereditary
most importantly love
like its the only thing you know how
at the end of the day all this
means nothing
this page
where youre sitting
your degree
your job
the money
nothing even matters
except love and human connection
who you loved
and how deeply you loved them
how you touched the people around you
and how much you gave them
i want to remain so
rooted to the ground
these tears
these hands
these feet
sink in
 grounded
you have to stop
searching for why at some point
you have to leave it alone
if you are not enough for yourself
you will never be enough
for someone else
you must
want to spend
the rest of your life
with yourself
first
of course i want to be successful
but i dont crave success for me
i need to be successful to gain
enough milk and honey
to help those around
me succeed
my heartbeat quickens at
the thought of birthing poems
which is why i will never stop
opening myself up to conceive them
the lovemaking
to the words
is so erotic
i am either in love
or in lust with
the writing
or both
what terrifies me most is how we
foam at the mouth with envy
when others succeed
but sigh in relief
when they are failing
our struggle to
celebrate each other is
whats proven most difficult
in being human
your art
is not about how many people
like your work
your art
is about
if your heart likes your work
if your soul likes your work
its about how honest
you are with yourself
and you
must never
trade honesty
for relatability
 to all you young poets
you tell me to quiet down cause
my opinions make me less beautiful
but i was not made with a fire in my belly
so i could be put out
i was not made with a lightness on my tongue
so i could be easy to swallow
i was made heavy
half blade and half silk
difficult to forget and not easy
for the mind to follow
give to those
who have nothing
to give to you
 seva (selfless service)
you split me open
in the most honest
way there is
to split a soul open
and forced me to write
at a time i was sure i
could not write again
 thank youhe guts her
with his fingers
like hes scraping
the inside of a
cantaloupe clean
your mother
is in the habit of
offering more love
than you can carry
your father is absent
you are a war
the border between two countries
the collateral damage
the paradox that joins the two
but also splits them apart
emptying out of my mothers belly
was my first act of disappearance
learning to shrink for a family
who likes their daughters invisible
was the second
the art of being empty
is simple
believe them when they say
you are nothing
repeat it to yourself
like a wish
i am nothing
i am nothing
i am nothing
so often
the only reason you know
youre still alive is from the
heaving of your chest
 the art of being empty
you look just like your mother
 i guess i do carry her tenderness well
you both have the same eyes
 cause we are both exhausted
and the hands
 we share the same wilting fingers
but that rage your mother doesnt wear that anger
 youre right
 this rage is the one thing
 i get from my father
 (homage to warsan shires inheritance)
when my mother opens her mouth
to have a conversation at dinner
my father shoves the word hush
between her lips and tells her to
never speak with her mouth full
this is how the women in my family
learned to live with their mouths closed
our knees
pried open
by cousins
and uncles
and men
our bodies touched
by all the wrong people
that even in a bed full of safety
we are afraid
father. you always call to say nothing in particular. you ask
what im doing or where i am and when the silence stretches
like a lifetime between us i scramble to find questions to keep
the conversation going. what i long to say most is. i
understand this world broke you. it has been so hard on your
feet. i dont blame you for not knowing how to remain soft
with me. sometimes i stay up thinking of all the places you
are hurting which youll never care to mention. i come from
the same aching blood. from the same bone so desperate for
attention i collapse in on myself. i am your daughter. i know
the small talk is the only way you know how to tell me you
love me. cause it is the only way i know how to tell you.
you plough into me with two fingers and i am mostly
shocked. it feels like rubber against an open wound. i do not
like it. you begin pushing faster and faster. but i feel nothing.
you search my face for a reaction so i begin acting like the
naked women in the videos you watch when you think no
ones looking. i imitate their moans. hollow and hungry. you
ask if it feels good and i say yes so quickly it sounds
rehearsed. but the acting. you do not notice.
it is your blood
in my veins
tell me how im
supposed to forget
i cant tell if my mother is
terrified or in love with
my father it all
looks the same
i flinch when you touch me
i fear it is him
when my mother was pregnant
with her second child i was four
i pointed at her swollen belly confused at how
my mother had gotten so big in such little time
my father scooped me in his tree trunk arms and
said the closest thing to god on this earth
is a womans body its where life comes from
and to have a grown man tell me something
so powerful at such a young age
changed me to see the entire universe
rested at my mothers feet
i struggle so deeply
to understand
how someone can
pour their entire soul
blood and energy
into someone
without wanting
anything in
return
 i will have to wait till im a mother
no
it wont
be love at
first sight when
we meet itll be love
at first remembrance cause
ive seen you in my mothers eyes
when she tells me to marry the type
of man id want to raise my son to be like
every revolution
starts and ends
with his lips
what am i to you he asks
i put my hands in his lap
and whisper you
are every hope
ive ever had
in human form
my favorite thing about you is your smell
you smell like
earth
herbs
gardens
a little more
human than the rest of us
the therapist places
the doll in front of you
it is the size of girls
your uncles like touching
point to where his hands were
you point to the spot
between its legs the one
he fingered out of you
like a confession
howre you feeling
you pull the lump
in your throat out
with your teeth
and say fine
numb really
 midweek sessions
i know i
should crumble
for better reasons
but have you seen
that boy he brings
the sun to its
knees every
night
you are the faint line
between faith and
blindly waiting
 letter to my future lover
nothing is safer
than the sound of you
reading out loud to me
 the perfect date
he placed his hands
on my mind
before reaching
for my waist
my hips
or my lips
he didnt call me
beautiful first
he called me
exquisite
 how he touches me
i am learning
how to love him
by loving myself
he says
i am sorry i am not an easy person to want
i look at him surprised
who said i wanted easy
i dont crave easy
i crave goddamn difficult
the very thought of you
has my legs spread apart
like an easel with a canvas
begging for art
i am ready for you
i have always
been
ready for you
 the first time
i do not want to have you
to fill the empty parts of me
i want to be full on my own
i want to be so complete
i could light a whole city
and then
i want to have you
cause the two of us combined
could set it on fire
love will come
and when love comes
love will hold you
love will call your name
and you will melt
sometimes though
love will hurt you but
love will never mean to
love will play no games
cause love knows life
has been hard enough already
id be lying if i said
you make me speechless
the truth is you make my
tongue so weak it forgets
what language to speak in
he asks me what i do
i tell him i work for a small company
that makes packaging for
he stops me midsentence
no not what you do to pay the bills
what drives you crazy
what keeps you up at night
i tell him i write
he asks me to show him something
i take the tips of my fingers
place them inside his forearm
and graze them down his wrist
goose bumps rise to the surface
i see his mouth clench
muscles tighten
his eyes pore into mine
as though im the reason
for making them blink
i break gaze just as
he inches toward me
i step back
so thats what you do
you command attention
my cheeks flush as
i smile shyly
confessing
i cant help it
you might not have been my first love
but you were the love that made
all the other loves
irrelevant
youve touched me
without even
touching me
how do you turn
a forest fire like me
so soft i turn into
running water
you look like you smell of
honey and no pain
let me have a taste of that
your name is
the strongest
positive and negative
connotation in any language
it either lights me up or
leaves me aching for days
you talk too much
he whispers into my ear
i can think of better ways to use that mouth
its your voice
that undresses me
he was supposed to be
the first male love of your life
you still search for him
everywhere
 father
my name sounds so good
french kissing your tongue
you wrap your fingers
around my hair
and pull
this
is how you make
music out of me
 foreplay
on days
like this
i need you to
run your fingers
through my hair
and speak softly
 you
i want your hands
to hold
not my hands
your lips
to kiss
not my lips
but other places
i need someone
who knows struggle
as well as i do
someone
willing to hold my feet in their lap
on days it is too difficult to stand
the type of person who gives
exactly what i need
before i even know i need it
the type of lover who hears me
even when i do not speak
is the type of understanding
i demand
 the type of lover i need
you move my hand
between my legs
and whisper
make those pretty little fingers dance for me
 solo performance
weve been arguing more than we ought to. about things
neither of us remember or care about cause thats how we
avoid the bigger questions. instead of asking why we dont
say i love you to one another as often as we used to. we fight
about things like: who was supposed to get up and turn the
lights off first. or who was supposed to pop the frozen pizza
in the oven after work. taking hits at the most vulnerable parts
of one another. were like fingers on thorns honey. we know
exactly where it hurts.
and everything is on the table tonight. like that one time you
whispered a name im pretty sure wasnt mine in your sleep.
or last week when you said you were working late. so i called
work but they said youd already left a couple hours ago.
where were you for those couple hours.
i know. i know. your excuses make all the sense in the world.
and i get a little carried away for no good reason and
eventually begin crying. but what else do you expect baby. i
love you so much. im sorry i thought you were lying.
thats when you hold your head with your hands in
frustration. half begging me to stop. half tired and sick of it.
the toxin in our mouths has burnt holes in our cheeks. we look
less alive than we used to. less color in our faces. but dont
kid yourself. no matter how bad it gets we both know you
still wanna nail me to the ground.
especially when im screaming so loud our fighting wakes the
neighbors. and they come running to the door to save us. baby
dont open it.
instead. lie me down. lay me open like a map. and with your
finger trace the places you still want to **** out of me. kiss
me like i am the center point of gravity and you are falling into
me like my soul is the focal point of yours. and when your
mouth is kissing not my mouth but other places. my legs will
split apart out of habit. and thats when. i pull you in.
welcome you. home.
when the entire street is looking out their windows wondering
what all the commotion is. and the fire trucks come rolling in
to save us but they cant distinguish whether these flames
began with our anger or our passion. i will smile. throw my
head back. arch my body like a mountain you want to split in
half. baby lick me.
like your mouth has the gift of reading and im your favorite
book. find your favorite page in the soft spot between my
legs and read it carefully. fluently. vividly. dont you dare
leave a single word untouched. and i swear my ending will be
so good. the last few words will come. running to your mouth.
and when youre done. take a seat. cause its my turn to make
music with my knees pressed to the ground.
sweet baby. this. is how we pull language out of one another
with the flick of our tongues. this is how we have the
conversation. this. is how we make up.
 how we make up
you were so afraid
of my voice
i decided to be
afraid of it too
when my mother says i deserve better
i snap to your defense out of habit
he still loves me i shout
she looks at me with defeated eyes
the way a parent looks at their child
when they know this is the type of pain
even they cant fix
and says
it means nothing to me if he loves you
if he cant do a single wretched thing about it
you were so distant
i forgot you were there at all
you said. if it is meant to be. fate will bring us back together.
for a second i wonder if you are really that naive. if you really
believe fate works like that. as if it lives in the sky staring
down at us. as if it has five fingers and spends its time placing
us like pieces of chess. as if it is not the choices we make.
who taught you that. tell me. who convinced you. youve
been given a heart and a mind that isnt yours to use. that
your actions do not define what will become of you. i want to
scream and shout its us you fool. were the only ones that can
bring us back together. but instead i sit quietly. smiling softly
through quivering lips thinking. isnt it such a tragic thing.
when you can see it so clearly but the other person doesnt.
dont mistake
salt for sugar
if he wants to
be with you
he will
its that simple
he only whispers i love you
as he slips his hands
down the waistband
of your pants
this is where you must
understand the difference
between want and need
you may want that boy
but you certainly
dont need him
you were temptingly beautiful
but stung when i got close
the woman who comes after me will be a bootleg version of
who i am. she will try and write poems for you to erase the
ones ive left memorized on your lips but her lines could
never punch you in the stomach the way mine did. she will
woman you let slip. nothing she does will excite you and this
will break her. when she is tired of falling apart for a man that
doesnt give back what he takes she will recognize me in your
eyelids staring at her with pity and itll hit her. how can she
love a man who is busy loving someone he can never get his
hands on again.
the next time you
have your coffee black
youll taste the bitter
state he left you in
it will make you weep
but youll never
stop drinking
youd rather have the
darkest parts of him
than have nothing
more than anything
i want to save you
from myself
she was a rose
in the hands of those
who had no intention
of keeping her
you have spent enough nights
with his manhood curled inside your legs
to forget what loneliness feels like
you whisper
i love you
what you mean is
i dont want you to leave
thats the
thing about love
it marinates your lips
till the only word your
mouth remembers
is his name
it must hurt to know
i am your most
beautiful
regret
i didnt leave because
i stopped loving you
i left because the longer
i stayed the less
i loved myself
you mustnt have to
make them want you
they must want you themselves
did you think i was a city
big enough for a weekend getaway
i am the town surrounding it
the one youve never heard of
but always pass through
there are no neon lights here
no skyscrapers or statues
but there is thunder
for i make bridges tremble
i am not street meat i am homemade jam
thick enough to cut the sweetest
thing your lips will touch
i am not police sirens
i am the crackle of a fireplace
id burn you and you still
couldnt take your eyes off me
cause id look so beautiful doing it
youd blush
i am not a hotel room i am home
i am not the whiskey you want
i am the water you need
dont come here with expectations
and try to make a vacation out of me
the one who arrives after you
will remind me love is
supposed to be soft
he will taste
like the poetry
i wish i could write
if
he cant help but
degrade other women
when theyre not looking
if toxicity is central
to his language
he could hold you
in his lap and be soft
honey
that man could feed you sugar and
douse you in rose water
but that still could not
make him sweet
 if you want to know the type of man he is
every time you
tell your daughter
you yell at her
out of love
you teach her to confuse
anger with kindness
which seems like a good idea
till she grows up to
trust men who hurt her
cause they look so much
like you
 to fathers with daughters
i am a museum full of art
but you had your eyes shut
you must have known
you were wrong
when your fingers
were dipped inside me
searching for honey that
would not come for you
the thing
worth holding on to
would not have let go
when you are broken
and he has left you
do not question
whether you were
enough
the problem was
you were so enough
he was not able to carry it
love made the danger
in you look like safety
even when you undress her
you are searching for me
i am sorry i
taste so good
when the two of you
make love it is
still my name
that rolls off your
tongue accidently
you treat them like they
have a heart like yours
but not everyone can be as
soft and as tender
you dont see the
person they are
you see the person
they have the potential to be
you give and give till
they pull everything out of you
and leave you empty
i had to leave
i was tired of
allowing you to
make me feel
anything less
than whole
you were the most beautiful thing id ever felt till now. and i
was convinced youd remain the most beautiful thing id ever
feel. do you know how limiting that is. to think at such a ripe
young age id experienced the most exhilarating person id
ever meet. how id spend the rest of my life just settling. to
think id tasted the rawest form of honey and everything else
would be refined and synthetic. that nothing beyond this
point would add up. that all the years beyond me could not
combine themselves to be sweeter than you.
 falsehood
i dont know what living a balanced life feels like
when i am sad
i dont cry i pour
when i am happy
i dont smile i glow
when i am angry
i dont yell i burn
the good thing about feeling in extremes is
when i love i give them wings
but perhaps that isnt
such a good thing cause
they always tend to leave
and you should see me
when my heart is broken
i dont grieve
i shatter
